# A_Simple_Game
Python Capstone Project II

This is a Python game that is inspired by the current Covid-19 situation.
The game consists of a single player that can move in 4 directions, up, down, left and right.
To move player use UP,DOWN,LEFT,RIGHT keystrokes on the keyboard.
This player is running from 'covid-19' enemies which will destroy him on collision, at which point player loses
To win the game the player has to get to the various 'prizes' on the screen and make contact.
The prizes are in form of a face-mask, sanitizer or gloves
Pretty much like life these days!
If 'covid-19' enemies are offscreen then the game ends due to time out.
